# HAND
Human Augmentation w/ Neural Data (EMG ML Pipeline)

This repository is a end-to-end machine learning pipeline for EMG gesture recognition. Currently uses Thalmic Labs myo armband to collect data, MATLAB to proccess data amd train model and a 5 servo robotic hand controlled by an Arduino Uno as the end effector.
